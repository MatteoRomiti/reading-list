        It is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal.

        From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad that government workers were a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor dad I would hear how the rich were greedy crooks who should be made to pay more taxes. Both sides have valid points. It was difficult to go to work for one of the biggest capitalists in town and come home to a father who was a prominent government leader. It was not easy knowing who to believe.

        No matter what the “Take from the rich” crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals, solely because they understood the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.

        The problem is, the people who lose are the uninformed. The ones who get up every day and diligently go to work and pay taxes. If they only understood the way the rich play the game, they could play it too. Then, they would be on their way to their own financial independence. This is why I cringe every time I hear a parent advise their children to go to school, so they can find a safe, secure job. An employee with a safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape.

        Every time people try to punish the rich, the rich don't simply comply, they react. They have the money, power and intent to change things. They do not just sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. They search for ways to minimize their tax burden. They hire smart attorneys and accountants, and persuade politicians to change laws or create legal loopholes. They have the resources to effect change.

        As the days passed, I grew more and more frustrated doing what I felt was pure manual labor—just trying to get Klee to work—without any intellectual content. This was the first time in my life that I had ever felt hopelessly overwhelmed by a work assignment. In the past, my summer internship projects were always manageable, and although lots of schoolwork in college was challenging, there was always a correct answer waiting to be discovered.

        Professors love to repeat the refrain, “If it’s already been done before, then it wouldn’t be research!” For the first time, I viscerally felt the meaning of those words.

        Unlike a regular nine-to-five job (e.g., my summer internships) where I could leave my work at the office and chill every night in front of the television, research was emotionally and mentally all-consuming. I found it almost impossible to shut off my brain and relax in the evenings

        Not only was it physically wearing me out, but it wasn’t even research! What would I write about in our paper—that I had spent nearly 1,000 hours of manual labor getting Klee to work on device drivers without obtaining any real insights? That wasn’t a research contribution; it just sounded foolish.

        I ended up wasting a lot of time and not extracting any meaningful insights from my readings. I also rode my bicycle aimlessly in the neighborhoods around campus in futile attempts to think of new research ideas. Finally, I procrastinated more than I had ever done in my life thus far: I watched lots of TV shows, took many naps, and wasted countless hours messing around online. Unlike my friends with nine-to-five jobs, there was no boss to look over my shoulder day to day, so I let my mind roam free without any structure in my life.

        The wiser course of action during those weeks would have been to talk to Dawson more frequently, and to actively seek out collaborations with other professors or senior students. But back then, I was so burned-out and frustrated with the traditional pecking order of group-based research— putting new Ph.D. students through the meat grinder on the most unglamorous work—that I recoiled and went off on my own.

        Unlike our peers with regular nine-to-five jobs, there was no immediate pressure for grad students to produce anything tangible—no short-term deadlines to meet or middle managers to please. For most students in my department, nobody would notice or care if they took one day off, so by extension, why not take two days off, a whole week off, or even a whole month off? Therefore, it’s unsurprising that many Ph.D. students who drop out do so around their third year.

        Academic conferences are filled with senior Ph.D. students, postdocs, and pre-tenure professors schmoozing like crazy in attempts to impress their senior colleagues. For these junior researchers, professional networking at conferences is a serious full-time job, since their budding careers and academic reputations depend upon excelling at it. But since I was getting out of this academic game, I didn’t care at all and enjoyed myself without being nervous or calculating.

        For those few months, I morphed into an antisocial grump who shunned all distraction and became deeply immersed in my craft. All I thought about was computer code; I could barely speak in coherent English sentences except during my weekly progress meetings with Margo. Even though I appeared and acted subhuman (i.e., an unshaven disheveled mess), my emotional state was blissful. I was programming and debugging for over ten hours per day, but my mind was quite relaxed since my technical skills were well-calibrated for the challenges I faced.

        a Ph.D. program provides a safe environment for certain types of people to push themselves far beyond their mental limits and then emerge stronger as a result. For example, my six years of Ph.D. training have made me wiser, savvier, grittier, and more steely, focused, creative, eloquent, perceptive, and professionally effective than I was as a fresh college graduate.

        This book is named The Ph.D. Grind because there would be no Ph.D. without ten thousand hours of unglamorous, hard-nosed grinding. This journey has taught me that creative ideas mean nothing without the extreme effort to bring them to fruition [...] However, grinding smart is just as important as grinding hard.

        He gave a speech, saying we would work on Saturdays and Sundays and sleep under desks until it got done. Someone pushed back from the table and argued that everyone had been working so hard just to get the car done, and they were ready for a break and to see their families. Elon said: "I would tell those people they will get to see their families a lot when we go bankrupt."

        "He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I've ever met," Gracias said. "What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else He didn't just survive. He kept working and stayed focused." That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk's main advantages over other executives and competitors. "Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray" Gracias said. "Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He's still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I've just never seen anything like his ability to take pain."

        All potential employees who make their way to the end of the interview process then handle one more task. They're asked to write an essay for Musk about why they want to work at SpaceX.

        The interview, he or she is told, could last anywhere from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing e-mails and working during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don’t panic. That’s normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face you. Even then, though, he might not make actual eye contact with you or fully acknowledge your presence.

        the absolute worst thing that someone can do is inform Musk that what he’s asking is impossible. An employee could be telling Musk that there’s no way to get the cost on something like that actuator down to where he wants it or that there is simply not enough time to build a part by Musk’s deadline. “Elon will say, ‘Fine. You’re off the project, and I am now the CEO of the project. I will do your job and be CEO of two companies at the same time. I will deliver it,’” Brogan said. “What’s crazy is that Elon actually does it. Every time he’s fired someone and taken their job, he’s delivered on whatever the project was.”
